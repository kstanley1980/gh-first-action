#  pull_request:
#    branches: [ "main" ]

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # Commented out as we are just echoing, no need for the checkout yet.

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
